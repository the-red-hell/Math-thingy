This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You basically have an right triangle, the hypotenuse is √2 then √3 and so on... One of the catheter is always 1 big and the other ones are first 1, when the hypotenuse is √2, √2 when the hypotenuse is √3 so it all comes together with c^2=a^2+b^2
